    "description": "JunoCasino is a permissinless casino built on the Juno Network that prioritise the ability for users to bet on various positions. By offering both liquidity markets and north-delegation pools, JunoCasino bridges the gap for medium-sized alpha markets that still base the consumer. It’s almost like Las Vegas when you think about it. Perhaps Montengro, I don’t really know that many gambling capitals of the world. This text is really just placeholder, and I’d be impressed if you read this far into it. Each project will be required to submit a medium-length description, no more than 1200 characters, describing their project and what the purpose is.",
